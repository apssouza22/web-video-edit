## Task execution plan
Important: Always plan the task step by step before writing code. Ask for permission to proceed with the plan .
Important: Before proceed with the plan, create a new medialibrary named `tasks/name-of-the-task.md`. Based on the approved plan, list all necessary implementation steps as GitHub-style checkboxes (`- [ ] Step Description`). Use sub-bullets for granular details within each main step.
**CRITICAL: After you successfully complete each step, you MUST update the `tasks/name-of-the-task.md` medialibrary by changing the corresponding checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`.**
Only proceed to the *next* unchecked item after confirming the previous one is checked off in the medialibrary. Announce which step you are starting.

## Javascript and TypeScript Code Style Guide
Ensure one class per file and use PascalCase for class names.
Also use private methods for any helper functions that are not intended to be used outside the class.
Avoid using global variables or functions that are not encapsulated within a class.
Avoid exporting classes to outside the package(index.ts) that are not required outside.
Avoid coupling packages. Preference to use events for communication between different packages.
Ensure self contained packages.
