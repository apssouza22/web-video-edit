## Task execution plan
Important: Always plan the task step by step before writing code. Ask for permission to proceed with the plan .
Important: Before proceed with the plan, create a new file named `tasks/name-of-the-task.md`. Based on the approved plan, list all necessary implementation steps as GitHub-style checkboxes (`- [ ] Step Description`). Use sub-bullets for granular details within each main step.
**CRITICAL: After you successfully complete each step, you MUST update the `tasks/name-of-the-task.md` file by changing the corresponding checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`.**
Only proceed to the *next* unchecked item after confirming the previous one is checked off in the file. Announce which step you are starting.

## Javascript and TypeScript Code Style Guide
Ensure one class per file and use PascalCase for class names.
Also use private methods for any helper functions that are not intended to be used outside the class.
In javascript use # for private methods
Avoid using global variables or functions that are not encapsulated within a class.
Avoid coupling packages. Preference to use events for communication between different packages.Ensure self contained packages.
Avoid adding code that is not being used in the current task.
