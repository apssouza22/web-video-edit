# Screen Recording Implementation Task List

## Phase 1: UI Integration

- [x] Add Screen Recording Button to Header

  - [x] Add "‚èπÔ∏è Stop Recording" button (initially hidden)
  - [x] Update header styling in CSS to accommodate new buttons
  - [x] Add onclick handlers for both buttons

## Phase 2: Screen Recording Service Class

- [x] Create ScreenRecordingService Class (`assets/js/record/service.js`)
  - [x] Define class properties:
    - [x] `mediaStream`: Store the display media stream
    - [x] `mediaRecorder`: Handle the MediaRecorder instance
    - [x] `recordedChunks`: Array to store recorded video chunks
    - [x] `isRecording`: Boolean flag for recording state
    - [x] `previewVideo`: Reference to preview video element
  - [x] Implement core methods:
    - [x] `startScreenCapture()`: Request display media and initialize recording
    - [x] `stopScreenCapture()`: Stop recording and process the final video
    - [x] `handleDataAvailable()`: Store chunks as they're recorded
    - [x] `createVideoBlob()`: Combine chunks into final video blob
    - [x] `addToVideoLayers()`: Integrate recorded video into the studio's layer system

## Phase 3: Recording Logic Implementation

- [x] Implement Recording State Management
  - [x] Use `navigator.mediaDevices.getDisplayMedia()` with audio/video constraints
  - [x] Set up `MediaRecorder` with appropriate codec (WebM/MP4 based on browser support)
  - [x] Handle recording state transitions:
    - [x] idle ‚Üí recording
    - [x] recording ‚Üí processing
    - [x] processing ‚Üí complete
  - [x] Implement error handling:
    - [x] Permission denials
    - [x] Unsupported browsers
    - [x] Recording interruptions

## Phase 4: Data Storage and Processing

- [x] Implement Frame/Chunk Storage System
  - [x] Store media recorder chunks in `recordedChunks` array during recording
  - [x] Implement progressive storage to handle long recordings without memory issues
  - [x] Add recording duration tracking
  - [x] Add file size monitoring
  - [x] Handle memory cleanup after recording completion

## Phase 5: Video Preview and Integration

- [x] Create Video Preview System
  - [x] Create preview video element that shows live screen capture during recording
  - [x] Position preview video element appropriately in UI
  - [x] Handle preview video lifecycle (show/hide based on recording state)

- [x] Integrate with Video Layer System
  - [x] Convert blob to video URL after recording stops
  - [x] Automatically create new video layer using existing `layer-video.js` system
  - [x] Add recorded video to timeline for editing
  - [x] Ensure recorded video works with existing video editing features

## Phase 6: UI State Management

- [x] Implement Button State Management
  - [x] Toggle button visibility (Record button ‚Üî Stop button)
  - [x] Show recording indicator (red dot animation)
  - [x] Display recording duration timer
  - [x] Update button text/icons based on state

- [x] Add Visual Feedback
  - [x] Add recording status notifications using existing popup system
  - [x] Show recording progress/duration
  - [x] Display recording resolution and format info
  - [x] Add visual indicator when recording is active

## Phase 7: Module Export and Integration

- [x] Setup Export Module (`assets/js/record/index.js`)
  - [x] Export the `ScreenRecordingService` class
  - [x] Create proper module exports structure
  - [x] Add initialization helper functions

- [x] Integrate with Main Application
  - [x] Import screen recording service in `main.js`
  - [x] Initialize screen recording functionality
  - [x] Make screen recording globally accessible
  - [x] Wire up button event handlers

## Phase 8: Error Handling and Browser Compatibility

- [x] Implement Robust Error Handling
  - [x] Check for `getDisplayMedia` browser support on page load
  - [x] Handle user permission denials gracefully
  - [x] Provide fallback messages for unsupported browsers
  - [x] Handle recording interruptions (user closes shared tab/window)
  - [x] Add error logging and user feedback

- [ ] Browser Compatibility Testing
  - [ ] Test on Chrome/Chromium browsers
  - [ ] Test on Firefox
  - [ ] Test on Safari (if supported)
  - [x] Add browser-specific handling if needed

## Phase 9: Testing and Polish

- [ ] Functional Testing
  - [ ] Test screen recording start/stop functionality
  - [ ] Test recorded video quality and format
  - [ ] Test integration with existing video editing features
  - [ ] Test memory usage with long recordings
  - [ ] Test error scenarios (permission denied, etc.)

- [ ] UI/UX Polish
  - [ ] Ensure smooth animations and transitions
  - [ ] Verify consistent styling with existing UI
  - [ ] Test responsive behavior on different screen sizes
  - [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts if applicable

- [ ] Performance Optimization
  - [ ] Optimize memory usage during recording
  - [ ] Ensure smooth recording without dropping frames
  - [ ] Test with different recording resolutions
  - [ ] Optimize blob processing and conversion

## Phase 10: Documentation and Cleanup

- [x] Code Documentation
  - [x] Add JSDoc comments to all methods
  - [x] Document class properties and their purposes
  - [x] Add inline comments for complex logic

- [ ] Cleanup and Final Review
