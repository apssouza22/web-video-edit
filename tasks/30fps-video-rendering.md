# 30 FPS Video Frame Rendering Implementation

## Task Overview
Implement precise 30 FPS video frame rendering in the demux worker to ensure consistent frame rate output regardless of source video frame rate.

## Implementation Steps

- [x] Add frame rate constants and configuration
- [x] Implement frame buffer system for smooth playback
- [x] Add precise timing mechanism for 30 FPS scheduling
- [x] Implement frame interpolation/dropping logic
- [x] Add frame scheduling with requestAnimationFrame optimization
- [x] Update worker message handling for frame rate control
- [x] Add performance monitoring and statistics
- [ ] Test and validate 30 FPS output consistency

## Technical Details
- Target: Consistent 30 FPS output
- Method: Frame buffering + precise timing
- Fallback: Frame interpolation/dropping as needed
- Performance: Optimized scheduling with RAF
