# Efficient 24 FPS VideoFrame Handling in Workers

## Implementation Steps

- [x] Create FrameRateController class for intelligent frame sampling/dropping
- [x] Implement frame buffer management with memory optimization
- [x] Add precise timestamp calculations for 24 FPS intervals
- [x] Integrate frame quality management for progressive loading
- [x] Enhance worker communication for frame rate feedback
- [x] Add performance monitoring and frame pooling
- [x] Update worker.js with new frame handling system
- [x] Test and validate 24 FPS output accuracy

## Technical Details

### Frame Rate Control Strategy
- Target: Exactly 24 FPS output regardless of source frame rate
- Method: Intelligent frame sampling with timestamp-based selection
- Quality: Maintain best possible frame quality while hitting target FPS

### Memory Management
- Efficient frame buffering with configurable limits
- Frame pooling to reduce garbage collection
- Progressive quality loading integration

### Performance Optimization
- Minimal frame copying and processing overhead
- Efficient timestamp calculations
- Smart frame selection algorithms
