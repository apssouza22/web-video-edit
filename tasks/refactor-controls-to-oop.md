- [x] Transform functions to private methods using # prefix
- [x] Add public initialization method to replace initScreenRecording function
- [x] Ensure proper event listener binding with arrow functions or .bind()
- [x] Update exports to export the class instead of functions
- [x] Test that all functionality remains intact after refactoring
- [x] Verify dropdown menu, recording buttons, and error handling work correctly
